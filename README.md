Overview of the project  ::-- 

Project:                  
Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data


Objective:                                
The objective of this project is to perform Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.


This code performs the following EDA tasks:                                      
1.Loads the Iris dataset and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame.                                
2.Explores the data's characteristics using info() and describe().                           
3.Visualizes the distributions of each feature using boxplots.                        
4.Visualizes the correlations between features using a heatmap.                       
5.Visualizes the scatter plot of each feature against the target variable.                        
6.Identifies outliers using the Z-score method.
7.Visualizes the outliers using a scatter plot.                      


Technologies used:                                   
Python                              
pandas                                       
numpy                                            
matplotlib                                
seaborn                                          


We can gain insights into the data, such as:                             
The distribution of each feature is roughly normal, but with some skewness.                   
There are strong correlations between the features, especially between sepal length and sepal width.                
The target variable is well-separated in the feature space, indicating that the features are useful for classification.                     
There are a few outliers in the data, which may need to be handled during model training.
